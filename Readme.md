## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) should be installed on your system.

### Using `requirements.txt`

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Create the Conda Environment**

   Create a new Conda environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

   ```sh
   conda create --name myenv --file requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Activate the Conda Environment**

   Activate the environment you just created:

   ```sh
   conda activate myenv
   ```

4. **Verify the Installation**

   Ensure all the packages are installed correctly by listing the installed packages:

   ```sh
   conda list
   ```

### Using `environment.yml`

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Create the Conda Environment**

   Create a new Conda environment from the `environment.yml` file:

   ```sh
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

3. **Activate the Conda Environment**

   Activate the environment you just created:

   ```sh
   conda activate myenv
   ```

4. **Verify the Installation**

   Ensure all the packages are installed correctly by listing the installed packages:

   ```sh
   conda list
   ```

### Updating the Environment

If you make changes to the `environment.yml` file and need to update the environment, you can use the following command:

```sh
conda env update --file environment.yml --prune
```

The `--prune` flag removes dependencies that are no longer required.

### Deactivating and Removing the Environment

To deactivate the current environment, use:

```sh
conda deactivate
```

To remove the environment completely, use:

```sh
conda env remove -n myenv
```
